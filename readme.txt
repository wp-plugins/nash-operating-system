== Description ==

Nash.Operating.System is a very simple Wordpress Plugin.

A WordPress Widget that allows to display items in the sidebar from a unique seller of any site that is powered by Nash.Operating.System.

You specify a site's url, a seller's username, a number of items to display, and optional keywords to filter the items.

== Installation ==

1. Download nash-operating-system.zip and unzip into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. From the Wordpress admin backend, Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu

3. From the Wordpress admin backend, in the Widgets menu, drag-and-drop
   the widget to your sidebar.  You can place it in any position you like.

4. Specify the settings for the widget:
   Title, Site URL, Username, Number of Items, and Keywords.  For the keywords, you can specify:

    - a single word, like "toyota".  This will fetch items with the word "toyota".

    - a pipe-separated list of the above. For example, if you specify
      "toyota|nissan|jeep|2014", then it will fetch items
	  with either "toyota" or "nissan" or "jeep" or "2014".


That's it !
